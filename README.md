# Python-Instacart Basket Analysis

## Introduction

Instacart, an online grocery store wants to increase sales through targeted marketing efforts. Instacart stakeholders are interested in understanding the variety of customers and their purchasing behaviours to implement a targeted marketing strategy.

## Objective

To derive insights and suggest strategies foe better customer segmentation to ensure Instacart targets the right customer profiles with appropriate products.

## Key Questions

* The sales team needs to know what the busiest days of the week and hours of the day are(i.e, the days and times with the most orders) in order to schedule ads at times when there are fewer orders.
 
* They also want to know whether there are particular times of the day when people spend the most money, as this might inform the type of products they advertise at these times.
  
* Instacart has a lot of products. Marketing and sales want to use simppler price range groupings to help direct their efforts.
  
* Are there certain types of products that are more popular than others? The marketing and sales team want to know which departments have the highest frequency of product orders.
  
* The marketing and sales teams are particularly interested in the different types of customers in their system and how their oedering behaviours differ. For example:
  
          1. What's the distribution among users in regards to their brand loyalty(i.e. how often do they return to Instacart?)

          2. Are there differences in ordering habits based on a customer's loyalty status?

          3. Are there differences in ordering habits based on customer's region?

          4. Is there a connection between age and family status in terms of ordering habits?

          5. What different classifications does the demographic information suggest? Age? Income? Certain types of goods? Family status?

          6. What differences can you find in ordering habits of different customer profiles? Consider the price of orders, the frequency of orders, the products customers are ordering, and anything else you can think of.

  ## Folders

  The project files are divided between the following folders:

  1. Project Management: Project Brief
 
  2. Data: It is separated in two subfolders. This folder is not uploaded to Github due to its size.
           1. original Data: It contains original dataset
           2. Prepared Data: It contains cleaned data which is prepared for analysis

  3. Scripts: The Jupyter notebooks containing the coding for the analysis.
 
  4. Analysis: It contains the visulizations used for developing and explaining insights.
 
  5. Sent to Client: The final report presented in Excel.
